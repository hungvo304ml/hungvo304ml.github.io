Following last year, TRECVID INS 2020 continues to tackle the problem of searching for specific person doing specific action. This year, we use the same person search system as in 2019 and only focus on improving the action search. Precisely, this work concentrate on solving the case when both the target person and the desired action appear in the shot but that action is actually perform by another person. This is one of the remaining problems which is the cause of many false positive cases in 2019. To alleviate this issue, we use a heuristic method to specify the target faces locations among other characters and a heuristic distance based method. Overall, our team achieves a notable performance in TRECVID INS 2020 by using only pretrained models and heuristic methods.
